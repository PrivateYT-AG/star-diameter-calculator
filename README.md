# Star Diameter Calculator
A simple web-based tool to measure a star's diameter, from its radius in solar radii (R☉).

## What it does
- Takes a star's **radius** (in solar radii, R☉)
- Calculator converts it to kilometers, doubles it, giving the **diameter** 

## How it works
It uses a simple formula:

$Diameter = radius \times 2$

You just have to input the star's radius, and press "Calculate diameter", and it will show you the result

## Features
- A simple UI

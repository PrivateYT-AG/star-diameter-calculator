# Star Diameter Calculator
A simple web-based tool to measure a star's diameter, from its radius in solar radii (R☉).

## What it does
- Takes a star's **radius** (in solar radii, R☉)
- Calculator converts it to kilometers, doubles it, giving the **diameter** 

## How to use (for now)
This app is not hosted as a website yet, so you will need to run it locally. Currently, it only supports PC.
- Click on the green **Code** button on the main page
- Select **Download ZIP**
- Unzip the downloaded `.zip` file
- Open `index.html` on your browser

## How it works
It uses a simple formula:

$Diameter = radius \times 2$

You just have to input the star's radius, and press "Calculate diameter", and it will show you the result.

## Limitations
This calculator assumes that all stars are perfectly spherical. While this works for most stars, some stars like Vega and Altair spin so fast that they bulge at the equator.

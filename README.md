# Star Diameter Calculator
A simple web-based tool to measure a star's diameter, from its radius in solar radii (R☉).

## What it does
- Takes a star's **radius** (in solar radii, R☉)
- Calculator converts it to kilometers, doubles it, giving the **diameter** 

## How to use (for now)
Because this is not a website this is how you are going to use this app. Keep in mind this app only supports PC as of now.
- Click on the green "Code" button on the main page
- Select "Download ZIP" and it will be downloaded as a .zip file
- After downloading, unzip the .zip file, and click on `index.html`

## How it works
It uses a simple formula:

$Diameter = radius \times 2$

You just have to input the star's radius, and press "Calculate diameter", and it will show you the result

## Features
- A simple UI

## Limitations
This calculator assumes that all stars are perfectly spherical. While this works for most stars, some stars like Vega and Altair spin so fast that they bulge at the equator.

Techical limitation 2: this website doesn't work on mobile yet
